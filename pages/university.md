#### Bayesian statistics

- [Predictive density and CPO](university/predictive and cpo.html)

- Project in Bayesian (nonparametric) clustering: [introductory slides](university/slides bayes.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/martinoischia/BayesianStatisticsProject)\\
It compares the behaviour of two different loss functions (Binder and variation of information)
for partition estimation, when the parameters of the prior are misspecified.

#### (Probabilistic) Measure theory


- [The Borel-Kolmogorov paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel%E2%80%93Kolmogorov_paradox)
, reason for which you need to define the limiting operation when you condition on a
0 probability event; measure theory "solves" this issue of conditional probability reasoning in terms
of sub-σ-algebras, introducing the concept of regular (version of a) conditional probability: conditional 
probability is defined as the conditional expectation of an indicator function. For more hints
have a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability_distribution#Measure-theoretic_formulation)

#### A (not so) simple [exercise in probability](university/exercise probability.html)
- I think it makes a good effort at showing the power of abstraction in Mathematics

#### Other
- [La matematica delle epidemie (and Maddmaths in general)](http://maddmaths.simai.eu/divulgazione/focus/epidemie-matematica/) (italiano).\\
